Peer reviewed by Amardeep Mann: Good work with the data validation. It catches if the user inputs a string and repromts them. One thing it doesn't account for yet is if the user inputs a decimal, probably should add that in the future. Lol I enjoyed the sarcastic response if the user goes rogue with their play-again response. Data validation works well for that but you may want to throw a ToLower() in a future revision just to account for users acting-a-fool with mixed-case responses. The actual numerical evaluation in the code works great and is fully accounted for with the if/else statements. Good work!
